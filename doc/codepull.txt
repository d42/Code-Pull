This file describes the code pulling plugin, which allows you to easily pull
code from sites like Github, Quora, Stack Overflow, and BitBucket without
leaving your editor. To use this plugin, simply enter command mode, and type
':Pull' followed by a description of the function you want. For example, if you
are writing in Python, and you want a function that reverses a string, you
simply have to type :Pull reverse string. Your file type is automatically
checked by the plugin to filter only relevant code. This plugin inserts the code
most likely to fulfill your search terms under the current line.
